Attempt tracker : That after how many attempts user win, so in future it enable me to add anoterh feture of scoring.

Exeting the game : While sometimes it's a fery intresting & easy game but sometime it become harder for us to guess the number so i have added the functionality that we the playes want to leave the game , 
they just enter any alphabet or unnumericall character to leave the game, 

Question 1?

while the function works normally but in the case user enter an unnumericall value , the message shown in the screen that ,  You exit this game by entering an alphabet or unnumericall value , 

Q no# 2 ?
